Last year, I did not apply to any internships because I was unmotivated and did not believe I would be able to secure one. This year I decided to crack down on myself and change my life around so that I could set myself up for a successful career. I began my search by first going onto handshake and searching for companies that I would be interested in. The first internship that caught my eye was PWC but since I knew that it would be a longshot for me to secure that company I applied and continued on with my search. The second company I applied to was Porter Keadle Moore which was a smaller accounting firm. Within a week of applying to these two firms, I was sent an email to start the interviewing process and I was excited and nervous at the same time. I thought that would be the end of my search but next up was the NABA conference and at the NABA conference I was offered an opportunity to interview for Grant Thorntonâ€™s internship. Between the three companies I was first awarded the internship with PWC which I thought would have been the one most difficult one to get. Later I was offered the chance to go to summer leadership conferences with Grant Thornton and PKM since already had an internship. My summer plans were in place and I was glad that I finally put in the time to secure my bag.
