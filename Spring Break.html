Can I go on a cruise with my friends for spring break pleeeeaaaassse? This year was the first year my parents allowed me to go on spring break with my friends because the idea of a whole bunch of teenagers traveling somewhere together was always terrifying to them. For our spring break, a group of us decided to go on a cruise through Royal Caribbean. The Cruise was a 5 day cruise and the two locations that we would stop in was Costa Maya, Mexico and Cozumel in Mexico. Some of my favorite things to do on the ship was the sports competitions and go to the casino. My friends and I got third place in one of the volleyball competitions and in the casino luckily I was able to leave with more money then I came in with by the end of the trip. Our first stop was in Costa Maya and in Costa Maya we just explored, ate and went to the beach which was very relaxing. We had the most fun in Cozumel because that is where we had an excursion which was two hours of ATV riding which ended with us being able to go to a private beach and do kayaking. Altogether the cruise was very fun and relaxing because I was able to get away with my friends and enjoy my week off from school.
