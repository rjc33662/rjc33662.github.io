In high school, one of the ways that I liked to stay active was to participate on different sports teams such as basketball, track and field, and cross country. For college I decided to not play officially for a school, however, I decided to join intramural teams so that I could stay active and meet new people that liked to do the same things that I did. This year I participated in intramural flag football and basketball. My coed flag football went undefeated the whole season and we also won the Championship. My basketball team struggled most of the season but when it came to the championship game we were able to defeat the team who we had lost to the worst. </p>
