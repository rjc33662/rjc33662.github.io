<p>21 21 21! This year I celebrated my 21st Birthday and it was hands down one of my best birthdays thanks to my amazing friends. Two days before my birthday I was told that on my birthday, January 7, I would be taken to dinner by my friends to Olive Garden. I never had anyone but my parents throw me a party so I was excited but, in the back of my head I was remembering how I always told my friends that I didn’t like birthday dinners so I had a little suspicion to the idea. The day before my birthday my parents threw me a party with my family and I would also bring in my birthday with my family which is always great! On my actual birthday I went back to school and would spend the rest of the day with my friends. At 8pm I got ready for my birthday dinner and as we were walking out of the door my friend says “wait I left my wallet at my house can we stop by on the way”. That was suspicion number two because these days people have venmo and cash app so there was no real need to go to her house but I just went with it. When we pulled up to her house she told us that we all had to get out of the car and help look for her wallet. At this point I knew that the whole situation was fishy, so by time we got to the door and everyone yelled <a HREF="Surprise.html">"SURPRISE"</a> I was no longer surprised. However, I did not expect so many people to be at the door and for the place to be so decorated. The rest of y birthday was made and they even made food since I thought I would be going to Olive Garden.</div>
